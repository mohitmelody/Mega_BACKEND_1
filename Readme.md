Welcome to Mega Backend, a robust and feature-packed backend solution built using Node.js and Express. Whether you’re developing a web application, mobile app, or any other project that requires a solid backend foundation, Mega Backend has got you covered.

# Features
#Express Framework: We’ve leveraged the popular Express.js framework to create a flexible and efficient server.

#MongoDB with Mongoose: Our backend *seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, and Mongoose provides an elegant way to model and interact with data.

#User Authentication with JWT: Secure your routes and authenticate users using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We’ve implemented middleware to handle token validation and user sessions.

#File Uploads with Multer: Need to handle file uploads? Multer simplifies the process, allowing you to manage files effortlessly.

#Cookie Management: We’ve included cookie handling for session management and user authentication.

#Cloud Storage with Cloudinary: Store and manage your media files in the cloud using Cloudinary. It’s reliable, scalable, and easy to integrate.




# Getting Started
#Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

#Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install all required dependencies.

#Environment Variables: Create a .env file and set up your environment variables (e.g., database connection string, Cloudinary credentials, JWT secret).

#Database Setup: Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. Update the database configuration in config/database.js.
